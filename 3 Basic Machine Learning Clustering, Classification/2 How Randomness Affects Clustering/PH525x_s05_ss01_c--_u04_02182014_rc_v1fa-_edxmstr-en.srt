00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:07,870
RAFAEL IRIZARRY: So, in a way, dendrograms, clustering, the results of clustering,

2
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:11,980
are data summaries just like any other data summary,

3
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:13,310
similar to the t-statistic.

4
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:16,129
The t-statistic is a data summary.

5
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:21,540
The one big difference, though, is that while summaries such as the t-statistic

6
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:27,140
are univariate, it's just one number, a dendrogram is not that simple.

7
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:30,390
It has many different aspects to it.

8
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:35,000
So what we can easily describe how much a t-statistic varies due to chance.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,430
It's a little bit harder to show, or to describe,

10
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:42,220
how clustering could have been different-- had we had another sample,

11
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:46,820
had measurement error been different-- but it is a random quantity.

12
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,250
So I want to illustrate that to give you a sense of how

13
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:52,340
strong the effect of variability can be on clustering.

14
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:56,900
This is particularly important to keep in mind because, in the literature,

15
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:02,361
you usually don't see uncertainty summaries attached to clustering, which

16
00:01:02,361 --> 00:01:04,569
makes some people believe that they're deterministic.

17
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:06,860
That this is the only cluster they could have happened.

18
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:08,380
That this is the final answer.

19
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:14,990
When, in fact, they are random just like any other summary statistic we compute.

20
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:17,270
So just to illustrate, I want to show you

21
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:19,720
a simple example created with simulations

22
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:23,020
which you can see in the class notes.

23
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:31,380
So for this stimulation, I created four profiles based on 50 genes.

24
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,560
So these 50 genes are different in the four profiles.

25
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,870
And then I created from those, 10 biological replicates from each group.

26
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:42,150
I added a little bit of measurement error.

27
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:46,290
And when I cluster these samples, we get perfect clustering,

28
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:49,840
and by group, which is not surprising.

29
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,780
Each group has a different profile therefore the distance between groups

30
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,360
is much bigger than the distance within group.

31
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,010
Now this is actually a realistic example.

32
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:07,320
Now let's suppose we run a microarray or we perform an RNA-seq experiment.

33
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:13,750
Now we have the 50 genes that changed plus thousands of others that don't.

34
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:17,430
So what happens when you add this is to the simulation, where you add thousands

35
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:20,430
of genes that don't change to the 50 that do?

36
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:23,420
Look at how much the clustering changes.

37
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:31,390
And no longer are the samples grouped by their original true profile.

38
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:33,980
You can see there's 2's and 4's here.

39
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:37,240
There's 2's mixed with the 4's, et cetera.

40
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,250
So that's a very important fact to keep in mind,

41
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:44,500
that clustering is also a random result.

42
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,000
