RAFAEL IRIZARRY: In this video, we&#39;re going to briefly describe

1
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:06,370
the mathematics between rotations.

2
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:11,360
This is very related to our previous video on projections.

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:16,940
So, as we saw in that video, we can take an example into two dimensions.

4
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:22,190
The vector 2,3, which is shown here on the right, as a point in space.

5
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:26,080
And we can write that as a multiplication of two

6
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:31,530
coordinates, two and three, and the bases 1 and 0 and 0 and 1.

7
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:35,730
But notice that we don&#39;t have to write it this way.

8
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:38,640
We can write the vector 2,3 in other ways.

9
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,870
So here we change the bases to 1,1 0.5, minus 0.5.

10
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:48,370
This gives us the average and the difference.

11
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:53,010
And what we see here is that the coordinates are now 2.5 and minus 1.

12
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,470
So the coordinates change, but the point is the same.

13
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:59,680
That&#39;s because the coordinate system changes as well.

14
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:05,420
Now, typically, we like to use bases that are orthogonal

15
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:08,620
and that their sum of squares is one.

16
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:11,434
So we would just multiply these by the square root of 2

17
00:01:11,434 --> 00:01:13,350
and divide the other by the square root of 2 to get

18
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:15,420
this alternative coordinate system.

19
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,580
And now our new coordinates are basically the same,

20
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:19,566
but they&#39;re shifted.

21
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,620
And then linear algebra gives us the rotation.

22
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:29,910
This is defined by the matrix A. And you can go back and forth

23
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:34,280
between the original data, Y, and the new coordinate,

24
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,667
Z. You can just go back and forth by multiplying by A.

25
00:01:37,667 --> 00:01:40,620
And this is, using our example from twins,

26
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:45,690
is literally rotating the data, in this case, 45 degrees.

27
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:50,700
And you can see it going back and forth, just by multiplying by A.

28
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,445
So this is what we call a rotation in mathematics.
