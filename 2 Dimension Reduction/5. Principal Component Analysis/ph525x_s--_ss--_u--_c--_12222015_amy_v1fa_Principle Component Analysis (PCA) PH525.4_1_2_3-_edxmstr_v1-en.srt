RAFAEL IRIZARRY: Once we understand the singular value decomposition,

1
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:09,080
we&#39;re ready to explain what principal component analysis is.

2
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:13,370
We&#39;re going to use this example that we&#39;ve used before with twin heights.

3
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:19,270
Each point represents the height of a twin 1 versus the height of twin 2.

4
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:25,590
And it&#39;s represented as a matrix that has n rows and two columns.

5
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:31,300
And the task that is related to principal component analysis

6
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,714
is to find a projection.

7
00:00:33,714 --> 00:00:36,130
We&#39;re going to find a vector that defines that projection.

8
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:38,310
Here we&#39;re going to call it V1.

9
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:42,530
That is orthogonal, so the cross product of V1 is 1.

10
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:46,920
And it maximizes the sum of squares of that projection, which

11
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:52,120
can be written as shown in this last equation here-- y projected to V1.

12
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,585
You take the cross product of that.

13
00:00:53,585 --> 00:00:55,020
That gives you the sum of squares.

14
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:59,265
We want to find a vector that maximizes that variability.

15
00:00:59,265 --> 00:01:01,570
What we&#39;re going to see-- we&#39;re going to try out

16
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:07,560
different Vs to motivate why it is that we end up with the optimal solution.

17
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,210
And it turns out that the optimal solution can be obtained

18
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:12,700
using the singular value decomposition.

19
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:16,640
So let&#39;s just try out some V&#39;s so you get an idea what&#39;s happening here.

20
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,720
So the first V we&#39;re going to try is simply 1, 0.

21
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,960
So that&#39;s the vector.

22
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,260
And when you project the data onto that vector,

23
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,850
you basically get back the height of twin 1.

24
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:34,757
You multiply y by v. The first dimension is kept,

25
00:01:34,757 --> 00:01:36,340
and the second one is multiplied by 0.

26
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:37,650
It goes away.

27
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:42,130
And we can easily compute the sum of squares for the first dimension,

28
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:46,187
and we get the number you can see at the top of the figure here.

29
00:01:46,187 --> 00:01:47,520
Now, can we do better than that?

30
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,895
So let&#39;s just try something else.

31
00:01:48,895 --> 00:01:51,210
Let&#39;s try the vector 1 minus 1.

32
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:52,560
Can we even use that one?

33
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,280
Well, we can&#39;t, because the cross product is not 1.

34
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,470
So we can easily fix that by dividing by the square root 2.

35
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:01,280
Now it does have that property.

36
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,720
And we&#39;re going to try this vector v. That

37
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:10,130
is basically giving us the difference, but standardized

38
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:14,400
to have an orthogonal transformation.

39
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,170
So if we use this, now what we&#39;re doing is projecting each point

40
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:23,170
to the space that is spanned by v, which is shown

41
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:25,780
with a diagonal line you see there.

42
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:30,640
Now we project each point, and we get the orange dots on that line.

43
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,230
Those are the projections.

44
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:36,061
So that&#39;s y multiplied by v. And we can take the sum of squares.

45
00:02:36,061 --> 00:02:36,810
That&#39;s easy to do.

46
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:39,900
We just take the cross product.

47
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,810
And in this case, we get a much smaller value than we did before.

48
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:47,140
So this is definitely not a solution.

49
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:51,220
So we can mathematically show that the solution to this problem, the v that

50
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:56,190
maximizes this, is 1 divided by the square root of 2,

51
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:59,140
1 divided by the square root of 2, as shown here.

52
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:04,260
We have seen this vector before in our videos on singular value decomposition.

53
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,990
And this one has a very high cross product.

54
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:13,240
When you map each point to the space spanned by v,

55
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,680
you can see that it has a wide range.

56
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,110
And it turns out that this is the solution.

57
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:22,850
So this vector that we&#39;ve just shown is the vector

58
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:28,630
that maximizes the sum of squares of yv 1, transposed yv 1.

59
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:32,140
And it&#39;s referred to as a first principal component.

60
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,490
That&#39;s what this V1 is.

61
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:35,460
It&#39;s also called an eigenvector.

62
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:40,550
And then y times V1 are the projection or the coordinates or eigenvalues.

63
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:43,920
These are just mathematical terminology.

64
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,810
But note that each row of y gets a coordinate, just

65
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:55,210
one value for each row of y in the example that we&#39;ve shown.

66
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:58,140
Now, to get the second principal component, what we do

67
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:03,950
is we take the residuals of-- we subtract--

68
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:07,030
you can call it an approximation of y based

69
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:10,680
just on that vector V1, as shown in this formula here.

70
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:16,550
And now with those residuals, you try to find a second vector that maximizes

71
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:19,140
the cross product for the residuals.

72
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:22,729
And then if we had more dimensions than two-- if we had m dimensions,

73
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:25,520
then we would keep going and get the third and fourth and fifth, et

74
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,490
cetera, using this procedure.

75
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:33,590
And that basically defines a principal component technique.

76
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:35,360
That&#39;s how you find them.

77
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,800
And again, you can find these using the singular value decomposition,

78
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,240
as shown in this code.

79
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,340
If we apply it, you can see it right here-- if we apply the singular value

80
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:48,530
decomposition to y, you can see that we get these two

81
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:51,490
vectors that we showed you earlier.
