RAFAEL IRIZARRY: In this module, we're going to give an example of how confounding

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:07,370
can affect a genomics data analysis.

3
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:12,480
We're going to use data from a paper that had as one of the results

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:18,310
that if you compared two ethnic groups and their gene expression,

5
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:20,930
they had thousands of genes differentially expressed.

6
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:24,090
A very large percentage of genes were differentially expressed.

7
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:27,850
We downloaded this data and performed the analyses ourselves

8
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:30,120
and in fact, we did find the same thing.

9
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:35,780
Here is a histogram of p values on the left and a volcano plot on the right.

10
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:39,243
And you can see that if we just by eye, we

11
00:00:39,243 --> 00:00:43,652
can see that perhaps something like 70% of genes

12
00:00:43,652 --> 00:00:45,360
would be called differentially expressed,

13
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,910
even after adjusting for multiple comparison.

14
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:51,810
And we can see on the volcano plot that the effect sizes

15
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:55,170
are pretty large in some cases as well.

16
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:58,380
So this, it's a very striking result.

17
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:03,070
I think we would not expect there to be so many differences between two

18
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:03,860
ethnic groups.

19
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:05,901
I mean, at the end of the day, we're both humans,

20
00:01:05,901 --> 00:01:09,870
and this is quite a dramatic difference.

21
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:13,620
So if you look at the data a little bit more closely,

22
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:17,530
and you extracted dates from the files that

23
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:20,820
have the data-- something that you'll learn to do in the labs

24
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,530
and by looking at the code for this lecture--

25
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:31,450
you'll see that the two ethnic groups are confounded with year.

26
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:38,970
So this ethnic group over here had most of the data processed in 2004

27
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:40,520
and before.

28
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,690
The second one and this other ethnic group

29
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:48,010
had most of it processed in 2005 and after that.

30
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:49,885
So just like we saw in the previous model,

31
00:01:49,885 --> 00:01:53,020
a confounded variable can make things seem

32
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:55,945
more different than they really are.

33
00:01:55,945 --> 00:01:59,070
And they can even make it seem different when they're really not different.

34
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:02,210
The same can happen with genomics data.

35
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:05,120
It's pretty much the same phenomenon.

36
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:11,600
So to show how this can happen, we're going to take two batches.

37
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,620
We're going to define them as batches.

38
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:18,860
We're going to take October 2005 and compare it to June 2005,

39
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,822
and we're going to stick to one ethnic group.

40
00:02:20,822 --> 00:02:22,280
So we're not going to have the two.

41
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,690
We're just going to have one of them.

42
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:27,660
And we're going to do the same analysis.

43
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:34,020
So when we do this analysis, the only difference is the date.

44
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,720
And when we compare genes from one batch the other,

45
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:42,040
we again get many, many differentially expressed genes.

46
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:46,290
So now the question is, when we saw the differences between the ethnic groups,

47
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:49,730
we know that that includes a date effect.

48
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:50,320
We know it.

49
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:54,390
It could also include an ethnic background effect.

50
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:58,270
But what we do know for sure, is that it does include a date effect.

51
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:00,860
So how do we parse those two out?

52
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:04,530
In this case, the experimental design was such

53
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:07,330
that data was pretty much completely confounded.

54
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:12,745
There's one or two exceptions of samples from the two ethnic groups that

55
00:03:12,745 --> 00:03:15,980
were run in the same batch.

56
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:18,720
But overall, they were very confounded.

57
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,800
In this case, it's almost impossible to separate the two.

58
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,180
Next module, we're going to take a subset of this data set

59
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:29,960
to show how we can adjust for batch effects

60
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,814
and find signal that has been corrected for it.

61
00:03:33,814 --> 00:03:34,314
