RAFAEL IRIZARRY: In the previous module, we described a way to account for batch effects

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,030
when we know what the batch effects are.

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:13,210
But we also saw evidence for us not really knowing

4
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:15,160
exactly what the batch effects are.

5
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:22,330
What are the sources of variability that are affecting our data?

6
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:27,330
So a more general model would be this surrogate variable model

7
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:31,900
in where we have, just like before, the outcome of interest, which

8
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:36,070
in the example that we've been looking at is sex, female or male.

9
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:37,790
We have measurement error.

10
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:43,170
But now we have this new term that describes the correlation

11
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:46,600
that we see between samples.

12
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,900
To simplify this part of the model, we're

13
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:55,170
assuming that it is determined by a series of columns

14
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,120
that are considered the batches.

15
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,750
So if we only had one batch, one of the columns of w

16
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:04,709
could just be a series of zeros and ones,

17
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:07,900
where one means you're in one batch, zero means in the other.

18
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:11,380
But now, we don't really know who is a zero and who is a one.

19
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:14,860
And we have to actually estimate that.

20
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:18,650
So the approach here is difficult because we

21
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:22,550
don't know what w is, we don't know what alpha is, we don't know what beta is.

22
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:28,187
All these things have to be estimated, which seems almost impossible to do.

23
00:01:28,187 --> 00:01:30,020
But there is a trick that statisticians have

24
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:34,500
been using for decades called factor analysis.

25
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:39,850
So notice that if beta is zero, if the effect of the outcome of interest

26
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:45,320
is zero, then all we're left with is the sources of variability.

27
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,740
We have the measurement error, and then we

28
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:52,600
have the effects that are associated with batch,

29
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,360
the surrogate values that we are calling batch effects.

30
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:00,670
So now the exercise is to find w and alpha.

31
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:06,551
And by making certain assumptions about how these are uncorrelated

32
00:02:06,551 --> 00:02:08,259
and how they're uncorrelated to noise, we

33
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:12,219
can actually estimate these w's and these alphas.

34
00:02:12,219 --> 00:02:15,010
And we're going to explain how to do that in the next module, where

35
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:20,800
we explain singular value decomposition and principal component analysis.

36
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,475
