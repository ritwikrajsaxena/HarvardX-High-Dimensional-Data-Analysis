00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:05,245
RAFAEL IRIZARRY: In the previous module, we showed you this model.

2
00:00:05,245 --> 00:00:07,120
That is the naive model we would fit if we were

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,780
interested in finding differences between males and females.

4
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:14,510
But it's not accounting for batch effects.

5
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:17,160
So how can we do that?

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,210
One of the first approaches suggested for genomics data

7
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:23,360
is a method called ComBat.

8
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:29,230
What ComBat does is it adds a row to the X

9
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:33,310
matrix that accounts for batch effects.

10
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:36,650
In this case, you have to know what the batch effects are.

11
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:39,440
In this case we know there's June and October.

12
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:44,430
So we're going to go ahead and add that covariate to the model.

13
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:47,180
In this case it would be on the third row

14
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:52,850
and we would have zeros for June, ones for October.

15
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:59,160
Then we add in a beta that will account for the fact that some genes are

16
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,270
affected by the batch and others aren't.

17
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:07,260
So when you do this, now you can estimate the parameters of interest--

18
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,300
in this case, it would be the beta ones-- taking into account the batch.

19
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:14,380
And if we do that and recalculate the

20
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:18,030
p-values that we calculated in the previous module, which are shown here.

21
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:22,450
So we were worried about the fact that we have too many genes

22
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:26,810
differentially expressed in the autosomes, and we apply ComBat,

23
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:28,900
we get slight improvement.

24
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:33,770
You see how this height dropped but the histogram on the right

25
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:35,480
didn't change much?

26
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,370
Which we don't want.

27
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:40,770
We don't want that to change, because these we believe are real differences.

28
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:43,510
But it's not completely flat.

29
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:48,770
And we wonder if maybe we haven't removed the entirety of the variation

30
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:49,790
due to batches.

31
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:53,590
So the limitation of ComBat is that it requires the user

32
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:56,000
to supply the batch effects.

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,860
In most cases we use the processing date.

34
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:05,030
However, my experience has shown me that processing date is just

35
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:09,150
a surrogate for other sources of variability.

36
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,770
And there's more to it than just date.

37
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:14,480
And we can't always know what is there.

38
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,190
Just to show you how that's a possibility here,

39
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:19,350
if we look at the dates, these are the dates

40
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:22,640
of all the samples in this complete data set,

41
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,810
not just the smaller set we constructed.

42
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:30,130
You can see that although there's some natural jumps,

43
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:31,820
there are also some slow movements.

44
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:34,060
You have one, a few done each day.

45
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,040
Then there's a jump.

46
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,380
So where do we split this to define batches?

47
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:41,860
In the smaller data set that we constructed, where we have 12 and 12,

48
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:47,510
you can see that the summer arrays and the fall arrays also

49
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:49,430
have days in between.

50
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,470
Here we have three days, here we have two days.

51
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:54,810
And maybe the mornings are different from the afternoons.

52
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:58,960
Many things can be happening here that we haven't annotated.

53
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,390
So how can we account for that?

54
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:05,620
In the next module, we're going to talk about factor analysis, singular value

55
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:11,234
decomposition, and then SVA as a solution to this problem.

56
00:03:11,234 --> 00:03:11,734
