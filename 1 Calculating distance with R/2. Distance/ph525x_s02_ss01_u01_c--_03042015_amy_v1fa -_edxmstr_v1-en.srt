RAFAEL IRIZARRY: In this video, we&#39;re going

1
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:06,490
to introduce the concept of distance in the context of the analysis

2
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:09,850
of high throughput data.

3
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:15,030
Clustering is a methodology that requires us to define distance.

4
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:18,990
Clustering is something that we do, and implicitly or explicitly, we

5
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:20,220
use distance to do it.

6
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:24,010
For example, when we cluster animals into groups, in a way,

7
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:25,340
we are defining a distance.

8
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:27,900
We&#39;re saying which animals are closer to each other,

9
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,860
and which animals are further away from each other.

10
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:33,980
If you read the genomics literature, you&#39;ll

11
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:36,940
have seen heatmaps such as this one.

12
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:41,640
In a heatmap, you can see on the left and the top,

13
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,570
you can see that there&#39;s a dendrogram, and these are created using clustering.

14
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:49,710
Therefore, we need to define distances between both rows

15
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:52,640
and columns of the data matrix.

16
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,530
So let&#39;s start with just a simple definition of distance.

17
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:58,330
This is just the Euclidean distance, if you

18
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:01,570
have two points in a Euclidean space.

19
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:03,920
We know how to compute the distance.

20
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,280
We subtract the difference in the x-axis, the difference in the y-axis,

21
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,220
square them, add them, and take the square root.

22
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:14,030
Now, in high dimensional data, we can&#39;t really

23
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:17,460
do that because points are not two dimensional.

24
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,960
Here&#39;s an example of a data set that we have been looking at.

25
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:26,170
And this is just the first 10 rows and five columns of a data set

26
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:30,260
that includes gene expression measurements for thousands

27
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:34,130
of genes on dozens of samples.

28
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:37,490
So to be able to talk about distance in this context,

29
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:40,210
the first thing we have to do is define what a point is.

30
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:44,500
We no longer have two points in space or in a Cartesian plane.

31
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,010
Instead, we have these, in the case of samples,

32
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:52,730
we have these long vectors that are 22,000-plus numbers long.

33
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:54,710
Now, once we know what the point is, then

34
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:58,360
we&#39;ll have to define what distance means for two samples or two columns,

35
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,210
and what distance means between two features or two rows,

36
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:05,220
or in the case of this data set, they&#39;re genes.

37
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:10,180
All right, so a point-- so a sample is simply a point in, in this case,

38
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:12,980
22,215 dimensional space.

39
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:15,980
Every gene gets a number, and all these numbers together

40
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,320
define a point for a sample.

41
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,970
In the case of features or genes, because this data set

42
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:28,170
has 189 columns, that&#39;s the number of dimensions we have for each feature.

43
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:32,640
Then once we&#39;ve defined points, then we basically use the same definition

44
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,550
that we use for two dimensions.

45
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:38,440
We take the sum of the differences squared, and then take the square root,

46
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,340
as shown in this formula for samples i and j.

47
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:47,830
So here, as an example, is the distance between the third

48
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:49,230
and the seventh column.

49
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:51,690
So you can see in the formula, we&#39;re simply

50
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:53,820
taking the third column and the seventh column

51
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,750
and applying the formula that we just showed.

52
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,310
For the rows, it&#39;s the same definition.

53
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,297
Instead now, we add across the samples.

54
00:03:02,297 --> 00:03:04,880
For each sample, we take the difference between the two genes,

55
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,860
square it, add them, take the square root.

56
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:18,130
So here&#39;s that formula applied to the row 5,124 and the row 11,924.

57
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:23,710
All right, so one last bit of math-- using

58
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:26,060
what we learned in the second course, we can

59
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:30,960
define distance, squared in this case, using the sum of squares.

60
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,467
That&#39;s what we do to compute distance between the difference

61
00:03:34,467 --> 00:03:35,300
between the columns.

62
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:38,780
So you can see here, the cross product between the difference between two

63
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:43,530
columns defines the distance squared between those two columns.

64
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,430
So this is a mathematical approach that we

65
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:48,250
can use to compute distances very quickly,

66
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,434
and we&#39;ll see that going forward.
