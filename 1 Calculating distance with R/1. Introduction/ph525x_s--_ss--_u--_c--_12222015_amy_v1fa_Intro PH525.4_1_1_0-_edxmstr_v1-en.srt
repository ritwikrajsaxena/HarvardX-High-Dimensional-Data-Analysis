RAFAEL IRIZARRY: This is High Dimensional Data Analysis.

1
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:08,010
In this course, we&#39;re going to learn several techniques that

2
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:11,620
are necessary to properly analyze some of the data sets

3
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:15,460
that are being generated by life science researchers.

4
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:19,930
So this is going to include techniques such as principal component

5
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:24,160
analysis, singular value decomposition, some of the mathematics

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,260
that you need to understand that, like projections and rotations.

7
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:31,250
We&#39;re going to learn the mathematical the concept of distance,

8
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:35,170
then permit us to learn about clustering, a little bit of machine

9
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:37,690
learning, smoothing techniques, and then we&#39;re

10
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:40,540
going to finish it off by learning about one

11
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:44,180
of the biggest challenges today in high dimensional data,

12
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:45,180
which are batch effects.

13
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,971
We&#39;re going to learn what they are and some

14
00:00:46,971 --> 00:00:52,170
of the statistical techniques that exist for attacking this problem.
